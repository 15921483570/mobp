### Why

On Mac OS, Microsoft Office keeps running in the background. But on Windows, clicking the close button will cause the process to exit.

If you have many plugins installed, or you are using a PC with a slow hard drive, starting and closing Office frequently will waste a lot of time.

This program will help you solve this problem.

### Usage

1. Download [release](https://github.com/kkocdko/mobp/releases) or compile yourself.
    * If the download fails, you can use [alternative link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LSWH7VVOYew7Anr05ZAbFw).

2. Make sure Microsoft Office is associated with the `docx` , `csv` and `pptx` extension.

3. Run `mobp.exe`.

### Note

* Run again to stop background processes.

* Deprecated for use with multi-tab plugins.

### Compatibility

* Windows 10 or higher.

* Microsoft Office 2013 or higher.
