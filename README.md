### Why

On Mac OS, Microsoft Office keeps running in the background. But on Windows, clicking the close button will cause the Office process to exit.

If you have many plugins installed, or you are using a PC with a slow hard drive, starting and closing Office frequently will waste a lot of time.

This program will help you solve this problem.

### Usage

1. Download [release](https://github.com/kkocdko/mobp/releases) or compile yourself.
    * If the download fails, you can use [alternative link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LSWH7VVOYew7Anr05ZAbFw).

2. Make sure Microsoft Office is associated with the `docx` , `csv` and `pptx` extension.

3. Run `mobp.exe`.

* If you want to stop, kill the office processes in task manager.
